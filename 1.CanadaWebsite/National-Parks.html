      <h2>National Parks</h2>
      <p>National parks are a country-wide system of representative natural areas of Canadian significance. By law, they are protected for public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment, while being maintained in an unimpaired state for future generations. National parks have existed in Canada for well over a century.</p>
