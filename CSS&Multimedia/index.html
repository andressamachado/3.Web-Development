          <h4><i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> are use to improve the appearence of the web content once it gives more formatting control than HTML. CSS also has something called stylesheet that allows the web designer to focus all the formatting in that file. It helps at the time of review or even modify, once the maintenance would be in just one file.Because all the presentation is developed in a separate file, the HTML files that are driven by the CSS StyleSheet, work better with accessibility tools, such as screen reader. Enriching experience.That is the same reason that makes those pages faster to download.Because of this feature, CSS may be used to adapt a page to respond to different browsers and window sizes. </h4>

An exemple of selector is the body tag name. To select all the elements, an * can be used as a selector. On the other hand, a grouped element selector is when a group of selectors shared the same declarations. For example:
          <br />
          header, nav, main { padding: 20px 30px; } </h4>
